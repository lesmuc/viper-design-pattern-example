# viper-design-pattern-example

Januar 2019

With the showcase app viper42 I have practiced the real world example of the software design pattern viper.

Using the Codable protocol in Swift 4. So please also have a look at the JSON parsing and the corresponding entities.

Of course this project is not in a finishing state. Next steps would be displaying the pictures in the list with AlamofireImage
and write some more unit tests for the interactor and presenter. But I hope itâ€™s enough code to get an impression of my coding experience.

If you have any questions regarding my code please feel free to ask me!
